- Correctness: Is your solution complete and does it pass different test cases?

well organized?
- Code Performance: Is your code efficient? Did you use appropriate data
structures?
- Best Practices: Did you utilize good programming practices (write unit tests,
avoid anti-patterns)? Did you show a good grasp of your language/framework of
